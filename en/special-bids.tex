			{%
				The declarer selects any card before the game begins. This card becomes the \emph{triumph trump}. The declarer decides who takes a trick containing the triumph trump when this trick is brought home. A triumph trump does \emph{not} change suit to the trumph suit, but retains its old suit.

				For the tricks in which the declarer doesn't lead, the declarer plays last.

			{---}
			{%
				If this bid is completed it is marked by a P, a \emph{potential}, in the declarer's column. The worth of all the declarer's future combo bids increase by \sfrac{1}{2} for each P in the declarer's column.
